{\bfseries N\_test}\\
The number of times, i.e. in how many iterations, 
the parameter-covariate relation has been tested.
%fixme backward counted?

{\bfseries N\_ok}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, does the scm log file list an ofv that such that extended model
has lower ofv than the base model?
%fixme

{\bfseries N\_localmin}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, did the run end in a local minimum, i.e. the log file lists a
higher ofv for the extended model than for the base model?

{\bfseries N\_failed}\\
How many times, out of N\_test, did the scm log file state that the model failed?

{\bfseries StepSelected} \\
In which forward step, if any, was the parameter-covariate relation selected?

{\bfseries StepStashed} \\
Only for scmplus: In which forward step, if any, was the parameter-covariate relation stashed, i.e. removed from the set of relations tested again?

{\bfseries StepReadded} \\
Only for scmplus: In which forward step, if any, was a previously stashed
parameter-covariate relation retested?

{\bfseries BackstepRemoved}\\ 
Both for scm and scmplus: 
In which backward step, if any, was a previously selected parameter-covariate relation removed?
