\section{Introduction and example usage}
The monitor script is used for monitoring an active scm or scmplus run.
Below are three snapshots from continuous monitoring of an scm run.

\section{Output columns}
{\bfseries Model}\\
The name of the model in the scm log file, which is composed of the parameter, covariate and state number.

\subsection{Columns summarizing the current iteration}
These columns only appear in the output from monitor when there is a current iteration. 
When the last iteration has finished, these columns are not present.

{\bfseries Forward/Backward\_N} \\
The column header is a unique identifier of the current iteration, composed of the search direction and the step number N in that direction. The column contents is the state in the current iteration 
for each model, for example notStarted, started or ok. 
The column is empty for models that are not run in the current iteration, for example models
representing already selected parameter-covariate relations.

{\bfseries ofvdrop}\\
The drop in ofv for each model. For a started but not finished model the current ofv is read from 
the psn.ext in the NM\_run subdirectory, and the drop relative the base model for the current iteration
is computed. For continuous monitoring this value will be updated several
times before the model is finished, as NONMEM writes new lines to psn.ext. 
Often ofvdrop can be negative at the start of a run, i.e. the current ofv is 
worse than the ofv of the base model. 
The column contains a - for models that are not run in the current iteration.

{\bfseries exceed\_eval}\\
This column will indicate whether a finished model had a NONMEM message about maximum number
of evaluations exceeded in the termination message. 0 means no, 1 means yes, and empty means
model either not finished or not run.

\subsection{Columns summarizing all iterations except the current}
These columns summarize the contents of the scm log file. 
They are not present until at least one iteration has been finished and written by PsN
to the scm log file.
NONMEM files are not parsed.

\section{Input and options}

\subsection{Required input}
The name of an scm or scmplus run directory is a required argument.

\subsection{Optional input}
